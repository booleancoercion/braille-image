about: Generates Unicode art from images using braille characters.
args:
  - INPUT:
    long_about: Sets the input file to use
    required_unless_present: use-existing
  
  - use-existing:
    long: use-existing
    long_about: |-
      Uses the existing canny dump generated with --debug instead of calculating it again.
      This is useful if you want to tinker with the settings and not have it take a long time every run.
      INPUT must not be present with this flag.
    conflicts_with:
    - INPUT
    - threshold
    - debug
    - sigma
  
  - scale:
    short: s
    long: scale
    long_about: Sets the scale factor to use with the image. Must be a positive real number.
    default_value: "1"
    takes_value: true
  
  - invert:
    short: i
    long: invert
    long_about: Inverts the image. This is used when you want to fill the bright spaces with dots instead of the dark ones.
  
  - threshold:
    short: t
    long: threshold
    long_about: |-
      Specifies the brightness threshold that determines whether a pixel will be converted to a dot or not.
      Must be an integer between 0 and 255.

      When used with --canny, this instead becomes the weak threshold, which must be between 0.0 and 1.0 .
    # default_value_if:
    # - canny: "0.1"
    default_value: "127"
    takes_value: true

  - debug:
    long: debug
  
  - sigma:
    long: sigma
    default_value: "0.4"
    long_about: |-
      Sets the sigma value to use with canny edge-detection.
      Recommended values are between 3.0 and 6.0.
  
  - canny:
    long: canny
    long_about: Specifies that the image should be processed using canny edge-detection with built-in/provided parameters.
